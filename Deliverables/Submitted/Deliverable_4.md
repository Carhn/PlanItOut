# Deliverable 4

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Implemented Requirements

## 3. Tests

***Reminders:***
1. The dart test package version 1.21.0 was utilized.
2. [Automated Testing Folder](https://github.com/Carhn/PlanItOut/tree/Dev/planner_cs386/test)
3. This test case is to check that items being added to our SQL database were actually being added.

## 4. Adopted Technologies
**Include a list of adopted technologies with a brief description and justification for choosing them.**

***Android Studio:***
Android Studio was adopted by the team as the emulator that will be used to run Android/iOS operating systems on our computers. It allows for
the creation of different mobile systems on a local pc, as well as, detailed interactions with cpu, memory and data management between the OS's
and programs being run on the emulator.

***Flutter:***
Flutter is the framework that will be used to implement the team's Calendar App. This framework runs on the Dart programming language which is 
a C-styled programming language with CSS functionalities. It is easy to learn and has usefule implemented libraries than can be used to create
complex mobile applications.

***DigitalOcean:***
DigitalOcean will be the cloud-based tool that the team will be using to manage the database on which the Calendar app will be implemented. 
This service provides tools for storage, authetication, "server"-side code, and integration of different systems into the database. These tools
will make the development of this project more feasible for our small team in the long-run.

***Visual Studio Code:***
Visual Studio Code ( VSCode ) is the IDE the team decided to use. VSCode is a lightweight IDE that provides a clean, simple environment that can 
be modified to suit almost all necessities for different programming languages and environments due to plugins. The entire team will be using the 
same plugins dedicated to running emulators from VSCode using the Flutter framework, in order to keep a controlled environment where no surprise
bugs can occur due to the use of different development environments.

***Github:***
All implementations and differents versions of the Calendar application will be stored and changed through a repository being ran on Github. All 
team members have admin access to the repository and are capable of adding changes when necessary.

***Discord:***
Discord is the communication application that was adopted by the team due to its simplicity and easy accessibility. It is further being used to 
store and discuss further developments to the application, as well as, to properly split and manage the application as its is split into smaller 
implementation groups among the team.

## 5. Learning/Training
**Describe the strategies employed by the team to learn the adopted technologies.**

Our team's major learning strategy was to divide the project into different implementation groups, where each group is responsible for researching
and implementing their sections. The splitting will be done by interest in the subject and time availability during the week. Before splitting the
project into sections, the entire team did general research on the tools that would be used to implement the application. After a general consensus
on tool use, each team member specified any qualities they had when it came to programming, such as, having some previous experience with database
programming or having experience as a front-end developer.

For all given sections, each small group will lead their own research on their topic to further add their implementation to the repository and 
eventually, have all sections working together as a mobile application. The research being conducted by each group will include the use of video
tutorials, documentation, and colleague feedback in order to implement each section properly.

Payton is the most experienced in the use of the Flutter framework and Dart programming language therefore the team is mostly using him as feedback for 
debugging sections of the code. Furthermore, due to time constraints, most meetings and training are being done over discord when necessary. All current 
and future implementations are being discussed over in the weekly meetings the team has, as well as, tracking the progession of the application in order
to have the project working on time.

## 6. Deployment

[***DigitalOcean:***](https://www.digitalocean.com)
 The intented cloud plaform for our server deployment is DigitalOcean.  We current have a server rented and running Ubuntu Server.  At this stage of
application development, the server is not being utilized.  Currently, the application stores information in a local instance of an SQL database, but this
will eventually be moved to our cloud server.

## 7. Licensing

***GNU GPLv3:***
 We selected the GNU General Public License as it's open source, and allows for the code to be used by anyone who would like to use it with the only caveat
being that any projects based of it must remain open source.
