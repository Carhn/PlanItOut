## 5. Code Quality
In order to guarentee a minimum level of code quality, and a uniform style, we had three best practices for writing project code:

	1) The use of self-describing variables.  The purpose of this is to make it clear to any one reading or reviewing code what data
	   a particular variable was being used to store.

	2) The inclusion of comments.  Comments are - we feel - necessary to include along side self-describing variables.  The variable
	   names make it clear what the variable stores, but not necessarily how it is being used or how it fits into the function or the
	   program as a whole.  To provide that context we employed the use of comments.

	3) Each of our project teams had standard tests that were utilized prior to submission of the new code, making sure that all new
	   code worked correctly.

Beyond our best practices for code development, we also required all merge requests to be reviewed and approved by a developer that did
not work on the section of the code being altered.  This was to gaurentee the code was legible and met our previously mentioned require-
ments.

## 6. Lessons Learned
For the second release of the software, the team further developed their respective sections (to-do list, calendar, reminders) by taking
into account the user stories we got at the beginning of the project. For each independent section of the project the entire team has
learned that implementing interactions between a software and a database is much more difficult that it seems at first sight. We managed
to figure out how to have the software data saved in a local database, but we all still having trouble figuring out how to save the data 
on the server database we have running on DigitalOcean. We have managed to make each individual section of the project more responsive and
user-friendly. Any further implementations will involve the further automation of the tests for each section.
