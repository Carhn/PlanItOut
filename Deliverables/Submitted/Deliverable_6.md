For the second release of the software, the team further developed their respective sections (to-do list, calendar, reminders) by taking
into account the user stories we got at the beginning of the project. For each independent section of the project the entire team has
learned that implementing interactions between a software and a database is much more difficult that it seems at first sight. We managed
to figure out how to have the software data saved in a local database, but we all still having trouble figuring out how to save the data 
on the server database we have running on DigitalOcean. We have managed to make each individual section of the project more responsive and
user-friendly. Any further implementations will involve the further automation of the tests for each section.
