INTRODUCTION
============
For our project, our goal was to solve the problem of poor time management and inefficiency as a result of needing to look at multiple different applications in order to see different times for certain events. What we want our project to be is a calendar app that has many functions that may come in other apps, such as a to do list, but has all of the features in the same app so that the user does not need to switch apps. This will be useful to users as it would allow for them to manage all of these different ways to track things in the same app without the inconvenience of having to constantly switch apps. Ideally, we hope to build an app that is very convenient for the user to use. 

INITIAL VALUE PROPOSITION
=========================
Plan It Out is an all-in-one calendar for users on mobile devices that allows users to better manage their time in a convenient app. 

Customer Segment: Our most important customers are those who use calendars on their phone a lot, their archetypes could be anyone who uses a calendar app on mobile for many different events, and it seems that the user wants us to make an application that is efficient and does not bog down the workflow of the person using it.
