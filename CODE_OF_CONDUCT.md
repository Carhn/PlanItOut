## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge
The main objective for contributors, developers, and maintainers of PlanItOut is to create and keep an environment
which is, at all times, inclusive, caring, open minded, and non-discriminatory. We do this to allow a community in
which anyone can feel welcomed to contribute so that productivity can be boosted as much as possible which in itsef
keeps our working environment in good shape.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include but are not limited to:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* Use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting comments
* ANY kind of harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission

### Our Responsibilities
The authors at PlanItOut are able to clarify and enforce the already defined standards, 
and will use their judgement to decide if any behavior not explicitly defined in the 
'Our Standards' section is enough to prohibit any kind of additional contributions to
PlanItOut. Last but not least, the authors at PlanItOut have the final say in which code
is added and which is removed from the repository.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting any of the following emails: <ap2974@nau.edu>, <es2386@nau.edu>, 
<jc328@nau.edu>, <phc6@nau.edu>, <lms737@nau.edu>, or <tjh488@nau.edu>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Those who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent 
repercussions as determined by other authors.
